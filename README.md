### important note :

This implementation makes use of the JFreeChart and JCommon libraries to display and update graphs easily. 
In order for this to be possible, I made use of the Maven build automation tool which allows easy installation 
of dependencies through a config file. Think of it like a big block of text that specifies what the project needs
and what libraries to link it with after compilation. Maven can be installed in a lot of different ways but the 
easiest way for this to work is through the use of the Maven plugin in IntelliJ IDE which makes things a lot simpler. 

IM REALLY SORRY IF THAT SOUNDS SUPER COMPLICATED,, I really wanted to get us extra points if possible through this but
yeah... Additionally, I made use of another database management system called MariaDB. MariaDB is basically the same 
as SQL except I for some reason cannot download SQL directly without spending 1 whole day looking through documentation
and wikis. So unfortunately, I will still have to replace certain lines just for compatibility, but I didn't change them 
yet when pushing as to make sure we're all in the same to what to do when merging all of these files together.
